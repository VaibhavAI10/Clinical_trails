# Clinical_trails
Project on Data Cleaning

### Data Description

This is a dataset about 503patients of which 350 patients participated in a clinical trail. None of the patients were using Novodra (a popular injectale insulin) or auralin( the oral insulin) being researched as their primary source of insulin before. All were experiencing elevated hbaIc levels.

All 350 patients were treated with Novodra to establish a baseline. HbaIc level and insulin dose. After 4 weeks which is it enough time to capture all the change in hba1c that can be attributed by the switch to auralin or novodra.

175 patients switched to auralin to 24 weeks.
175 patients switched or remain to novodra for 24 weeks.

Data about patients feeling some adverse effect is also recorded.
